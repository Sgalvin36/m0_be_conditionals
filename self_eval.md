# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

Any time that you are looking to compare two or more different values for different results. 
If you want every result to return the same, there is no need for conditionals, but since we want our programs to process data for us, we need to compare the values to create those differences

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would like to have practiced more with my commits to git. I went through all the exercises before thinking to commit each file as I finished. So I only did one commit for all the work, and then
I'll do a second for the evaluation.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I was happy that I remembered more about the times I had spent outside of Turing studying up on programing. It helped especially with the spicy prompt to know how to break down the problem, and 
where to go looking for solutions.
